- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Happybycker I am new to railway digital .
I have a WeMOS Mega + WiFi R3 ATmega2560 + ESP8266 USB-TTL for NodeMCU Arduino Mega | WEMOS Mega + WiFi R3 ATmega2560 + ESP8266 (32 MB memory), USB-TTL CH340G. Mega Compatible, NodeMCU, WeMos ESP8266. The current DCC-ex version installed is 5.0.7
I added an EX-MotorShield8874.
